# Streamlit Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows you to create web applications for data science and machine learning with minimal effort. It is designed to make it easy for data scientists and engineers to turn data scripts into shareable web apps.

### 1.2 Key Features

- **Rapid Prototyping:** Build interactive and data-driven web applications quickly.
- **No Web Development Skills Required:** Streamlit abstracts away the complexities of web development, enabling users to focus on data and insights.
- **Easy to Learn:** Streamlit has a simple and intuitive API that makes it accessible to beginners.
- **Wide Range of Widgets:** Includes a variety of widgets for user interaction, such as sliders, buttons, and text inputs.
- **Built-in Data Visualization:** Easily integrate charts and plots into your applications.

### 1.3 Installation

To install Streamlit, use the following pip command:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## 2. Getting Started

### 2.1 Hello World Example

Create a file, e.g., `app.py`, and add the following code:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Hello Streamlit!")
st.write("This is a simple Streamlit app.")
```

### 2.2 Running Your Streamlit App

In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing `app.py` and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local development server, and you can view your app in a web browser.

### 2.3 Streamlit Layout

Streamlit apps are built using a simple layout with elements like `st.title`, `st.write`, and more. Learn about the layout in the [Streamlit Layout Guide](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/layout_api.html).

## 3. Widgets and Components

### 3.1 Text Input

```python
user_input = st.text_input("Enter your name:", "John Doe")
st.write(f"Hello, {user_input}!")
```

### 3.2 Button

```python
if st.button("Click me"):
    st.write("Button clicked!")
```

### 3.3 Slider

```python
value = st.slider("Select a value", 0, 100, 50)
st.write(f"You selected: {value}")
```

### 3.4 Data Frames

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({"Column 1": [1, 2, 3], "Column 2": [4, 5, 6]})
st.dataframe(data)
```

### 3.5 Charts and Plots

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

chart_data = pd.DataFrame({"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [10, 20, 30]})
st.line_chart(chart_data)
```

Learn more about widgets and components in the [Streamlit Widget API](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html).

## 4. Customization

### 4.1 Theming

Change the theme of your app using the `st.set_page_config` function. Example:

```python
st.set_page_config(page_title="My Streamlit App", page_icon=":chart_with_upwards_trend:", layout="wide")
```

### 4.2 Custom CSS

Customize the appearance of your app using custom CSS. Add a `style` tag in your app:

```python
st.markdown(
    """
    <style>
        /* Your custom CSS styles go here */
    </style>
    """,
    unsafe_allow_html=True,
)
```

### 4.3 Layout Customization

Organize your app layout using columns and containers. Example:

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.write("Column 1 content")
with col2:
    st.write("Column 2 content")
```

---

## 5. Advanced Topics

### 5.1 Caching

Improve app performance using Streamlit's caching capabilities. Example:

```python
@st.cache
def expensive_computation():
    # Expensive computation here
    return result

result = expensive_computation()
st.write("Result:", result)
```

### 5.2 Sharing Streamlit Apps

Share your app with others using Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, or other deployment options. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy_streamlit_app.html) for details.

### 5.3 Deployment Options

Explore different deployment options, including Streamlit Sharing, Heroku, AWS, and more. Refer to the [deployment documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy_streamlit_app.html) for details.

### 5.4 Integrating with Databases

Connect your Streamlit app to databases like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. Example using SQLite:

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("example.db")
data = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM table_name", conn)
st.dataframe(data)
```

## 6. Best Practices

### 6.1 Code Structure

Organize your Streamlit app code into functions for better readability and maintainability.

### 6.2 Performance Optimization

Use caching for expensive computations, and be mindful of resource-intensive operations.

### 6.3 Security Considerations

Avoid exposing sensitive information in your app, especially if deployed publicly. Implement proper security measures.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### 7.1 Common Issues

Refer to the [Streamlit Troubleshooting](https://docs.streamlit.io/troubleshooting.html) guide for solutions to common issues.

### 7.2 Debugging Streamlit Apps

Use the `st.debug()` function to print debugging information to the Streamlit app.

```python
st.debug("
